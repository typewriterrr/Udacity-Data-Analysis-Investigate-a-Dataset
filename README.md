Dataset Description

For my Data Analysis Project, I will be working on the 'tmdb-movies' dataset. I chose this dataset because I am a huge fan of hollywood movies. This dataset contains more than ten thousand movies and contains valuable information about those movies including budget, revenue, and profit.

My questions for Analysis

I will seek to answer the following questions with my Analysis today:

Which movie was the most and least profitable?
Which movie had the longest and the shortest runtime?
Which movie had the highest and the lowest budget?
Which movie was released the latest and the earliest?
I will also analyze the genre for successful movies and determine if directors have influence over profitability of the movies with visualizations.
